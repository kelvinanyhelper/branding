This is the script of some of Apples branding video

a: I have been thinking a lot about innovation lately, how does that happen? 

a: For me, it's having a great team that is empowered and given the space to do what they know how to do.

b: We get to realize ideas. And Apple people have some crazy ideas. 
b: Just to be with all these smart people here -- it's hugely inspiring. Plus you know you are working on a product that's going to reach millions of people. What can be better than that?

c: I take a lot of pride in what I do and so does everyone I work with. And being around people who care so deeply about what they do that really is what motivates me.

d: There are very few individuals that go into the level of detail that we do. We drive consistently for perfection

e: BUt all those technical things, all they do is they add up to an exeprience for the customer. That is seamless that is easy, that is just natural.

f: "Oh that is so cool! I love it!"

g: It all looks so smoothless and seamless. Underneath, every single detail has thousands of people behind it.

h: We at Apple are lookg for people who are passionate about what they do. And that passion it doesn't necessarily come from experience. Doesn't necessarily come from education. It comes from within.
